# AutoFib

This script is an Auto Fibonacci Retracement tool for the TradingView platform, designed to automatically plot Fibonacci levels based on price pivots. It uses the average true range (ATR) to determine significant price movements and identify pivot points dynamically. Users can customize various parameters, including the depth of the pivot lookback, whether to extend lines to the left or right, and the appearance of the Fibonacci levels (including custom levels beyond the standard ones). Additionally, it features options to reverse the direction of the retracement, adjust the price format for labels, and choose the label's position.
